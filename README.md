## About

Tanjong Selamat is a leisure hobbyist project from zuhra. It is a theme based on the [understrap](https://github.com/holger1411/understrap) by awesome person [Holger Koenemann](http://www.holgerkoenemann.de/).

It is as free as a bird. I mean you can catch it, put it under your own wordpress cage, and no one will ever complain, as long as you feed it. Tho I prefer to let the birds flying free.

TanjongSelamat is a small village located on the small spot in westest part of Sumatra Island. It means safe cape.

# UnderStrap Legacy 

## Confused by All the CSS and Sass Files?

Some basics about the Sass and CSS files that come with UnderStrap:
- The theme itself uses the `/style.css`file just to identify the theme inside of WordPress. The file is not loaded by the theme and does not include any styles.
- The `/css/theme.css` and it´s minified little brother `/css/theme.min.css` file(s) provides all styles. It is composed of five different SCSS sets and one variable file at `/sass/theme.scss`:

                  - 1 "theme/theme_variables";  // <--------- Add your variables into this file. Also add variables to overwrite Bootstrap or UnderStrap variables here
                  - 2 "../src/bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap";  // <--------- All the Bootstrap stuff - Don´t edit this!
                  - 3 "understrap/understrap"; // <--------- Some basic WordPress stylings and needed styles to combine Boostrap and Underscores
                  - 4 "../src/fontawesome/scss/font-awesome"; // <--------- Font Awesome Icon styles

                  // Any additional imported files //
                  - 5 "theme/theme";  // <--------- Add your styles into this file

- Don’t edit the files no. 2-4 files/filesets or you won’t be able to update it without overwriting your own work!
- Your design goes into: `/sass/theme`. Add your styles to the `/sass/theme/_theme.scss` file and your variables to the `/sass/theme/_theme_variables.scss`. Or add other .scss files into it and `@import` it into `/sass/theme/_theme.scss`.

## Installation

- Download the understrap folder from GitHub or from understrap.com
- IMPORTANT: If you download it from GitHub make sure you rename the "understrap-master.zip" file just to "understrap.zip" or you might have problems using child themes !!
- Upload it into your WordPress installation subfolder here: `/wp-content/themes/`
- Login to your WordPress backend
- Go to Appearance → Themes
- Activate the UnderStrap theme

## Developing With npm, Gulp and SASS and [Browser Sync][1]

### Installing Dependencies
- Make sure you have installed Node.js and Browser-Sync* (* optional, if you wanna use it) on your computer globally
- Then open your terminal and browse to the location of your UnderStrap copy
- Run: `$ npm install` and then: `$ gulp copy-assets`

### Running
To work and compile your Sass files on the fly start:

- `$ gulp watch`

Or, to run with Browser-Sync:

- First change the browser-sync options to reflect your environment in the file `/gulpfile.js` in the beginning of the file:
```javascript
var browserSyncOptions = {
    proxy: "localhost/theme_test/", // <----- CHANGE HERE
    notify: false
};
```
- then run: `$ gulp watch-bs`

## How to Use the Build-In Widget Slider

The front-page slider is widget driven. Simply add more than one widget to widget position “Hero”.
- Click on Appearance → Widgets.
- Add two, or more, widgets of any kind to widget area “Hero”.
- That’s it.
